   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Template's documentation!
====================================

This repository serves as a template for python code. To understand what all these folders are here for see `here <https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/packaging_demo>`_.
In some situations, you may not want all of this structure. In that case you can just delete folders you don't want.

At a minimum, you should update the following aspects:

- README.md: fill out
- DemoPackage: rename to something representing your code e.g "FullySickAnalysis"
